_sf_lib
=======
This is the function library for the WordPress theme [_Second Foundation](https://github.com/Shelob9/_second_foundation). It is included (as of v1.1.0) in the main theme. Its purpose for being a submodule is so it can be included in a child theme, such as [_Second Speaker](https://github.com/Shelob9/second_speaker) in order to override the parent themes functions.
